## Project Idea

We want to predict the price of bitcoin using historical bitcoin data as well as its sentiment analysis over time. We are planning on experimenting with time series models such as LSTM to predict token price. To measure sentiment analysis, we will be using the fear and greed API which measures engagement with Bitcoin.
